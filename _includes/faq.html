				<p><strong>What is a hackathon?</strong></p>
				A hackathon is an event where curious people get together to work on developing software projects in a short amount of time. 
				Participants typically start by brainstorming, they get an idea, plan it, and implement the code for it. 
			</div>
			<div class="col-xs-6 col-sm-3">
				<P><strong>Why a hackathon for women?</strong></P>
				We want more women to get involved in software development because ultimately, the variety of software products available to 
				the world would be much greater if more women started hacking now.	 
			</div>
			<div class="col-xs-6 col-sm-3">
				<P><Strong>I don't have any coding experience, can I still participate?</strong></p>
				Yes! A hackathon provides the perfect environment for you to learn how to code quickly. All you have to do is try something 
				and the experience automatically follows.

				<P><Strong>I'm a man, can I still participate?</strong></p>
				I'm a man; can I still participate?
				Of course! While our target market consists of women, we welcome men as well. If you plan to work in a team with women, please 
				let us know in your registration, and you will be given special consideration.
			</div>
			<div class="col-xs-6 col-sm-3">
				<P><Strong>Do I need a team?</strong></p>
				You can work alone if you choose. However, teamwork is a valuable skill. Just remember to keep teams at a max of 4 members.

				<P><Strong>Can I come if I am still in high school?</strong></p>
				Sorry, no.
			</div>
			<div class="col-xs-6 col-sm-3">
				<P><Strong>What should I bring?</strong></p>
				Please bring a laptop, and an extension cord if you have one. Since we will be hacking overnight, you might also want to bring a 
				sleeping bag, and a toothbrush/toothpaste.
			</div>
			<div class="col-xs-6 col-sm-3">
				<P><Strong>How much will it cost?</strong></p>
				Hackhers is 100% free! All we ask for is some honest effort and a positive attitude :)
